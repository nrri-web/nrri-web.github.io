title: "The Bypass of Local Gas Distribution Utilities"
subheadline: "How can you tell if it is for real?"
author:
  - Alvin Kaufman
teaser: "State utility commissions are faced with the necessity of screening out real bypass candidates from those who are attempting to take advantage of the situation, i.e., the bluffers. In order to begin such screening, the regulator must ask questions. NRRI was asked to set out the appropriate questions a public utility commission should ask in an effort to decide if the threat of bypass is real. In order to formulate what needs to be asked, we attempt, in this paper, to carefully define bypass, discuss why it may be considered a problem, analyze the characteristics of a bypass candidate, and finally pose the questions."
