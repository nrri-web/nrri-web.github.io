subheadline:  "Options for Universal Service Contribution in a Broadband World"
title: "Broadening the Base"
teaser: "The seminar will focus on potential options for modifying the basis for universal service contributions to reflect the changing telecommunications landscape. Panelists will address ways to broaden the number of contributors as telecommunications users move from traditional landline service to VoIP, Wireless, and other technologies.  The seminar will discuss who should contribute and how those contributions should be calculated and will address the various proposals suggested in response to the FCC's NPRM on contribution, including transitioning from a circuit-based system to one based on numbers, connections, or other considerations."
