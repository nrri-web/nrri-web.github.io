teaser: "The natural gas transportation policy currently being fashioned at the
FERC is changing the way in which gas is bought and sold in the U.S. and the way in which its cost is regulated by state public utility commissions. Local gas distribution companies are likely to have much greater freedom in contracting for gas than during any period in the history of the industry. Instead of relying mostly on its traditional interstate pipeline supplier(s), a distributor may have future
opportunities to participate directly in the wellhead gas market and to arrange to transport the gas it buys through interstate pipelines that have decided to participate voluntarily in the federal gas transportation program under the FERC Orders 436 and 500. Consequently, state regulators are faced
with the prospect of reviewing, understanding, and overseeing a distributor's contractual arrangements for gas supply to a much larger extent than was the case when a FERC-regulated pipeline was the
distributor's principal supplier. This report examines several facets of the resulting effects on state regulatory policies, procedures, and oversight activities, recent changes in the federal transportation program, and quantitative models to determine an optimal portfolio of gas supply sources."
