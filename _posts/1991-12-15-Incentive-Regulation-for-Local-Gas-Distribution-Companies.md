title: "Incentive Regulation for Local Gas Distribution Companies Under Changing Industry Structure"
author:
  - Mohammad Harunuzzaman, Kenneth W. Costello, Daniel J. Duann, and Sung-Bong Cho
teaser: "State regulators have been striving to develop responses to the emerging competitive environment in the gas industry. A major issue worth examining is whether current state regulation provides correct incentives to local gas distribution companies (LDCs) to efficiently utilize many opportunities offered by the new and rapidly changing gas market. The study examines gas purchase opportunities currently available to the LDC, which have expanded significantly in the post-Order 436 era. These expanded opportunities also make the design of a purchase portfolio much more complex than in the pre-Order 436 era. This complexity is likely to grow further following the final implementation of the NOPR (also known as the 'mega-NOPR')."
