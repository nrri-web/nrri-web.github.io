title: "Natural Gas Rate Design and Transportation Policy Under Deregulation and Market Uncertainty"
author:
  - J. Stephen Henderson, Jean-Michel Guldmann, Ross C. Hemphill, and Kyubang Lee
teaser: "The natural gas industry in the United States today, while not in crisis, stands at an important crossroad. The direction of its future evolution is not yet clear, but important changes in its organization seem likely. Although the major regulatory reforms are occurring at the federal level, PUCs are active participants in the process. To assist the state PUCs in these matters, NRRI was asked to study natural gas design issues in the context of the greater market uncertainty that is likely to accompany the current reforms. This report addresses these rate design issues in particular and in addition discusses gas transportation policy, a topic that has gained considerable importance since the inception of this research."
