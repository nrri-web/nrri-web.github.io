teaser: "In 1986, The National Regulatory Research Institute undertook a project specifically directed toward keeping state regulators of natural gas utilities informed about policy issues emerging from changes in the structure of the gas industry. We have done this through a series of short reports and papers related to gas industry restructuring. The four papers in this volume are offered as a contribution to the public policy debate on how state regulators can best respond to the restructuring of the gas industry."
