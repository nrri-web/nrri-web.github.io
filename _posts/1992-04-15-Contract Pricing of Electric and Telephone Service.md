teaser: "Utility services are increasingly provided under contracts or special tariffs negotiated
between utilities and customers outside the traditional rate case. Such contracts or special tariffs
may be offered to provide economic development rates, incentive rates, interruptible rates, or
rates for special services. They often include prices set below regular tariff rates for the same or
similar services, and may be subject to less regulatory scrutiny than that applied to regular tariffs.
How widespread is the practice? What are commission attitudes and policies towards it?
What criteria do regulators use in evaluating contracts and special tariffs? To what extent should
regulators and ratepayers be concerned? Does the practice of providing utility services under
individually negotiated contracts or special tariffs require developing new regulatory policy?"
