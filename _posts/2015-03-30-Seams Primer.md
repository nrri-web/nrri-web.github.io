teaser: "Seams are the products of valuable interconnections to neighboring jurisdictions. They are the interface between two wholesale electricity control areas, systems, and markets. Seams issues are trading barriers between adjoining wholesale electricity markets resulting from the use of different rules and procedures by the neighboring markets. Put another way, where there are seams, inefficiencies arise that prevent the economic transfer of capacity and energy between neighboring wholesale electricity markets largely as a result of incompatible market rules or designs. These trading barriers can obstruct the trading or sharing of electric capacity and energy between the two markets, affecting the reliability of each system and increasing the ultimate cost to the ratepayer. This primer offers an examination of seams issues that are relevant to the Eastern Interconnection in the United States."
