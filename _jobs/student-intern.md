NRRI is seeking student intern(s) to assist NRRI's Researchers in data research and analyses. Information about NRRI is available on www.nrri.org.

While NRRI has deadlines to meet for its paper and projects, it will be mindful of the selected student intern's academic schedules. On average, no more than 10 hours per week is required; daily attendance in the NRRI office is not required but the student must have access to the Internet/email and be proficient in the use of MS Office. Work relationship will be strictly between NRRI and the student intern as NRRI research may contain confidential/proprietary information. Depending on projects, stipends may be available but no benefits will be provided.

Requirements:
Current undergraduate students who are interested in learning about energy, environment, and telecommunications issues are encouraged to apply. Applicants must have completed some coursework in subjects such as economics, political science, energy, environmental sciences, public policy, and related fields.

Expressions of Interest:
If interested, please send a cover letter, latest resume with a list of relevant courses, and a writing sample of no more than five pages as a PDF file (only) to "employment@nrri.org". This posting may close at any time.
