Governor Donald L. Carcieri nominated Paul J. Roberti for appointment to the Public UtilitiesCommission for a six-year term expiring March 1, 2015.

Prior to his appointment, Mr. Roberti served for 17 years in the Rhode Island Attorney General's Office, most recently as Assistant Attorney General and Chief of the Regulatory Unit. In that capacity, he has been involved in hundreds of proceedings involving public utility and energy matters before the Rhode Island Public Utilities Commission, the Rhode Island Energy Facility Siting Board, the Rhode Island Supreme Court and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). In representing the interests of Rhode Island ratepayers and residents, Mr. Roberti played a key role in preventing the siting of a proposed liquefied natural gas terminal in Providence. He spearheaded the burial of high-voltage transmission lines along the Providence and East Providence waterfronts to enhance economic development opportunities and preserve parklands. Mr Roberti saved an estimated $250 million for Rhode Island's electric ratepayers by securing concessions in a FERC-approved settlement agreement that authorized implementation of the Forward Capacity Market in New England. He played a pivotal role in a rate settlement associated with National Grid's consolidation of Rhode Island's largest electric distribution companies, an agreement which yielded a $13 million rate reduction, a five-year rate freeze and the state's acquisition of 260 acres of pristine land on Narragansett Bay.

Commissioner Roberti received a Bachelor of Arts degree from the College of the Holy Cross and a Juris Doctor degree from Suffolk University Law School, graduating Cum Laude, and is a member of the Rhode Island Bar Association. Commissioner Roberti resides in North Kingstown with his wife and three children.
