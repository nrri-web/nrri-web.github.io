Commissioner Patch earned a B.A. in Economics and a Juris Doctor from Willamette University in Salem Oregon. Commissioner Patch is admitted to practice law in both Iowa and Alaska. He arrived in Alaska in 1974 after service with the United States Air Force in various capacities and was assigned as Deputy Staff Judge Advocate for the 21st Air Base Group at Elmendorf Air Force Base. He was also designated for special duty with the Alaskan Command.

Upon entering the private practice of law Commissioner Patch practiced with a pronounced emphasis on litigation. His litigation experience included personal injury matters, complex multi-party litigation, construction industry disputes, and derivative corporate actions. He litigated matters in both state and federal courts. Commissioner Patch subsequently developed an ADR practice not limited to Alaska. He was asked to serve as a member on a number of national arbitration and mediation panels and enjoyed serving throughout the Pacific Northwest with the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, the National Mediation Board, the National Association of Securities Dealers, and the American Arbitration Association. He served on permanent dispute resolution and interest arbitration panels maintained by Pacific Northwest states as well as serving many Alaska and Northwest Municipalities and on ad hoc industry dispute resolution panels. He achieved Chair designation on multiple party, labor, and complex matters as a result of his lengthy and recognized service and his dedication to attending and providing training to less experienced ADR practitioners as well as to Employers and Alaska Unions. He served for a number of years as the Alaska advisor to the American Arbitration Association and as a panel member on the Labor, Business, Construction, and Complex Multi-Party panels of that organization.

Commissioner Patch has advised or served on boards of directors of non-profit corporations serving Alaskans.

Commissioner Patch served as an Administrative Law Judge for the Regulatory Commission of Alaska at the time of his appointment by Governor Parnell.
